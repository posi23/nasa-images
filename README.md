A fully responsive website/application named Spacestagram that displays images gotten from a NASA API and allows users to like or unlike each image.

Developed using ReactJS for the frontend development and CSS for the styling.
API used is https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod

NOTE: Website only returns images of 25 days (with the 25th day always being today's date). This is to allow the webiste successfully fetch data without user having to wait for an annoyingly long time, and to avoid connection timeout.

Below is the link to the deployed website (deployed using Heroku):
